## Laser and Super Cancels ##

Lasers can be super cancelled into any EX Laser or EX Somersault:

> ([6]4A or [6]4B) XX (1C or 7C)

This will cancel any Laser into EX Laser. 
So if you do B Laser cancelled into EX Laser, you will 
effectively have two lasers active covering two directions.

This works because the charged input from holding 6 is still active for a few frames.
During those frames, if you input another "back" direction (1 or 3), it will activate the
super cancel.

Similarly, you can also do:

> ([3]4A or [3]4B) XX (7C or 8C or 9C)

This will give you any Laser super cancelled into EX Somersault.
