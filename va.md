# Vatista Notes #

## Neutral Game ##

Fragmentum is a really strong tool to have in neutral. If you can get
these out safely, they will threaten just by occupying areas near 
your attack ranges. Use Vatista's lasers, balls, and normals to 
bring out Fragmentum safely.

### Pressure & Mix-up ###

If you are holding a Frag you can confirm any blocked 3C into a Frag Set.

> 3C > cr.Fragmentum > ...

From there you can do a number of mix-ups!

> j.[9]A > j.A (detonate) > B Drill

This blockstring sets up a high/low mix-up. The second j.A comes out when
you are falling from the jump. Confirm that j.A is blocked then cancel it
into B Drill to create a fuzzy guard. Note that there is a gap between j.A
and the B Drill. EX Reversal moves can get out of this setup as well as a 
well-timed backstep. Another way for the opponent to get out of this setup
is to Shield the falling j.A. In doing so, Vatista will be unable to cancel
into B Drill.

### GRD Control ###

> Crouching Fragmentum Set > Concentrate

Observed from an Atepo match versus Hyde. Establish that you are 
willing to detonate Fragmentum in neutral to cover the space in 
front of you. Then, if you set a Crouching Fragmentum you can 
stay behind it from 5A distance and use this time to Concentrate 
and build GRD.

## Combo List ##

### Random B Drill starter ###

_Always a good idea to convert random hits into damage. The timing on the 66C is earlier than you expect._

> wallbounce > 66C > 5A > jc9 > j.A > j.B > j.C > land > j.A > j.B > A Drill > 
> ...

### 2C + 100 meter ###

_Hitconfirm 2C into 4000+ dmg!_

> 2C > 5C > jc[9] > j.A > j.B > [A] Drill > [3][C] > crouch Fragmentum A > [3]
> A > A Laser (detonate) > crouch Fragmentum C > [2]B > EX Somersault

### Corner j.C ###

_Safe jump and detonates Fragmentum to hit meaty. Really strong._

> j.C > 2C > 5C > jc[9] > j.A > j.[B] > j.]8[2A > 2[C] > 2]B[ > 2A > 2B > 2]C[ > delay j.B (detonate) okizeme

### Hyde Craver Punish ###

_Punish a DP with a Veil Off combo!_

> 2C High Counter > 5C > jc[9] > j.A > j.B > j.]8[2[A] > 2[C] > 5B > 5]A[> 5A >> 5B > 2]C[ > VO (detonate) > j.[9]C > j.FF > j.]8[2C > IW okizeme (dash 
> crouch Fragmentum)
